=======
A simple working example of using CMake to build a C++ project that uses vcpkg in manifest mode.

Build Instructions

Since we're using vcpkg, need to have that availble on the PATH.
Pre-build:
vcpkg install (installs everything listed as a dependency from vcpkg.json)

Build:
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
